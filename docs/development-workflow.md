4. **Documentation** - Update docs as you make changes

### **When to Ask for Help:**
- **After 30 minutes** of being stuck on the same issue
- **Before making major changes** to existing code
- **When you're unsure** about the best approach
- **After completing a task** to verify it's correct

- Test before committing
- Keep commits focused on single features

### **Testing:**
- Test each feature as you build it
